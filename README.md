My personal site created with [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) & [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com), utilising [Lanyard](https://discord.com/invite/UrXF2cfJ7F), [GitHub](https://api.github.com) and [Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com) API.


## 📚 Credits

This personal website is heavily inspired/built off of [Anaxes's Personal Website](https://Anaxes.xyz).

🔗 GitHub: [DiscordAnaxes](https://github.com/DiscordAnaxes)

_*Note: Audun recently updated their personal website and github repo. My personal website is built off of a previous version of their website._

## 🚀 Getting Started

To start off, please clone the repository:

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/jokerxtd/joker.is.a.dev/
```

Next, change directory:

```bash
cd joker.is-a.dev
```

Then, open the directory (This step is for Visual Studio Code. Please refer to your prefered IDE/Text Editor on how to open folders/directories.):

```bash
code .
```

## 🏷️ Lanyard, 🐈 GitHub API & 🐤 Twitter API

Firstly, you want to change the API endpoints in `/assets/JS/lanyard.js`, `/assets/JS/github.js`, `/assets/JS/discord.js`, & `/assets/JS/twitter.js`.

In those files please change the ending of the API endpoints:

lanyard.js & discord.js files:

```bash
https://api.lanyard.rest/v1/users/<your discord id>
```

Github.js file:

```bash
https://api.github.com/users/<your github username>
```

Twitter.js file:

Unfortunately the endpoint for the Twitter API is custom and only retrieves my Twitter account data. You'll have to use your own system on getting Twitter data. 

_*Note: To use Lanyard API you <strong><u>must</u></strong> join their [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/UrXF2cfJ7F)_

## 🔍 Deploy on Netlify

The easiest way to deploy a website for free, is to use a provider called [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

Check out the [Netlify deployment documentation](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/) for more details.
